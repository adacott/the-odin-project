    Javscript can be added to an html file directly by doing:

    <script>
    // Your javascript goes here
    console.log("Hello World!")
    </script>

    Now, to view your code, you would launch the html file in the browser, open the dev tools, then go to the console to see the message.
    The other way to insert javascript for more complex scripts is to use an external script. Here, just like you link html, you would
    do the same with js by typing:

        <script src="javascript.js"></script>

    And then populate the external script file with the code you want to run

    ⁡⁢⁣⁣Variables
        ⁡⁢⁢⁣Declare variables in javascript with:
            var, let and const can be used to declare variables⁡⁡
            ⁡⁢⁣⁣let:⁡
                let message = "Hello!";      let user = "John", age = 25, message = "Hello!";
                let user = "John",
                    age 25, message = "Hello";
            ⁡⁢⁣⁣var:⁡
                var message = "Hello";
            Case matters: for example, apple and APPLE are two different variables
            Variables can be declared with num = 5 for example, as long as you dont put "use strict" in your script to maintain compatibility
                with older scripts
            ⁡⁢⁣⁣cont:⁡
                To create a constant unchanging variable, use const instead of let:
                    const myBirthday = "18.04.1982";
                It is good practice to use constants as aliases for difficult to remember values that are known prior to execution, like color hexes
                    These constants are always named using capital letters and underscores like so: const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
    Alert() can be used to print a variable or message 

    Quote types and Strings:
    "", '', `` can all be used to declare strings. Double and single qutoes are functionally the same thing, however backticks (``) allow you to embed variables
    and expression into a string by wrapping them in ${} for exampe:
        let name = "John";
        alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
