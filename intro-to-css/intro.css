/* At the most basic level, the css syntax is made of various rules
There is a selector, a semi-colon separated list of declarations, and each declaration has a property:value pair */
/* 
selector {
    property:value;
} 
*/

/* The universal Selector: */
* {
    color:purple;
}
/* In this example, every element would have the color:purple style applied to it */

/* Type Selectors: */
/* A type selector will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element. */
div {
    color: white;
}
/* This one automatically selects the type in the html file */

/* Class selectors */
/* Class selectors select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place  */
.alert-text{
    color:red;
}
/* This is how the html application would look like: */
/* <p class = "alert-text">Number 1 - I'm a class!</p> */


/* ID Selectors */
/* Similar to class selectors. Selects an element with the given id, which is another attribute you place on an html element.
The major difference between this and classes is that an element can only have one ID (cannot be repeated on a single page) */
/* Ids will use a hastag before them instead of a period */
#title {
    background-color: red;
}

/* The grouping selector: */
/* If two groups of element share some of their style declarations, they can be grouped together: */
.read, .unread {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
}
.read{
    color-scheme: yellow;
}
.unread{
    color-scheme: blue;
}

/* Chaining selectors: */
/* Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without separation. */
/* Say you had this code here:
<div>
<div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
<p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div> 
Both of them have "subsection" elements with some unique styles, but what if we only want a separate rule
to the element that also has header as a second class? This can be done with chaining the class selectors together
in CSS like so: */
.subsection.header{
    color: red;
}

/* This can also be used to chain a class and an ID as shown below: */
.subsection#preview{
    color: blue;
}

/* Generally, you can chain anything except for two type selectors, since an element can't b e two different types at once. */

/* Descendant Combinator */
/* Allow you to combine multiple selectors differently than grouping or chaining. 
It shows a relationship between the selectors. */
/* the descendent combinator is represented in CSS by a single space between 
selectors. It will cause elements that match the last selector
to be selected if they also have an ancestor that matches the previous selector. */
.ancestor .contents {
    background-color: blue;
}
/* So something like .ancestor .child would select an element with the class child if it has an ancestor with the class ancestor. 
Another way to think of it is child will only be selected if it is nested inside of ancestor, no matter how deep. Take a quick look 
at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided: */

/* Properties to get started with: */
/* Color and background color: */
color: yellow;
background-color: red;
color: transparent;

/* Typography basics and text-align */
/* font-family can be a single-value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses */
    /* Each falls into one of two categories, a font-family like "times new roman", or a "generic family name" like sans-serif */
    /* Common practice is to list most-wanted first, then provide alternatives: */
    family: "Times New Roman", sans-serif;

/* font-size sets the size of the font. This should contain no white-space, i.e.: */
    font-size:22px

/* font-weight affects the boldness of the text. Can be a keyword, like bold, or a number from 1 to 1000. */
    font-weight: bold
    font-weight: 800

/* text-align will align text horizontally within an element, and common keywords can be used like this: */
    text-align: center

/*  Image height and width. You could auto-adjust an image's size by setting one attribute to auto, then changing the other: */
img {
    height: auto;
    width: 500px;
}


/* Now that we have learned some basic syntax, how do we actually add all the CSS to html? There are three methods to do so: */
    /* External CSS */
        /* the most common method you will come across, involves creating a separate file for the css and linking it inside of an html's
        opening and closing <head> tags with a self-closing link> element */
            /* 
            <!-- index.html -->

            <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
            </head> 
            */
        /*  href is the location of the css file. The rel attribute is required, specifying the relationshup between the HTML file and linked file */

    /* Internal CSS */
        /* Involves adding the css within the html file itself instead of creating a separate file. Here, you place all rules inside of a pair of 
        opening and closing <style> tags of your html file. Since styles are placed directly inside of the head tags, we no longer need a link element */
                /* 
                <head>
                <style>
                div {
                    color: white;
                    background-color: black;
                }
            
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
                </style>
            </head>
            <body>
                ...
            </body> 
            */

    /* Inline CSS: */
        /* Makes it possible to add styles directly to html elements, though this is not as recommended! */
            /* 
            <body>
            <div style="color: white; background-color: black;">...</div>
            </body> 
            */
        /* Most notable is that we don't actually use selectors here since the styles are added to div */
        /* This method would primarily be for adding a unique style to a SINGLE element, but generally is pretty messy and should be avoided. */


/* THE CASCADE: */
/* Specificity
    A CSS declaration will use more specific calls first, then move to less specific.
    INLINE styles have the highest specificity compared to selectors, while each type of selector has its
        own specificty level that contributes to how specific a declaration is. Other selectors can contribute too,
        but of the ones we have gone over: 
            1. ID selectors (like #title, most specific selector)
            2. class selectors (like .article)
            3. type selectors (like div)  
    Specificity will only take a role wHen an element has multiple, conflicting declarations regarding it.
        When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, the one with the larger amounts of single
        selectors will take precedence. 
        /* rule 1 */
        /* 
        .subsection {
            color: blue;
        }
        
        /* rule 2 */
        /* 
        .main .list {
            color: red;
        } 
        */
    /* In this example, rule 2 will take precedence because it has the most number of single selectors since 
    they both share hte same specificity. */
        /* rule 1 */
        /* 
        #subsection {
            background-color: yellow;
            color: blue;
        } 
        */
        
        /* rule 2 */
        /* 
        .main #subsection {
        color: red;
        } 
        */
    /* Note that in the above example, rule 2 will take preference because both have an id, but rule 2
    has an additional class selector and so has higher specificity. However, background-color yellow from rule
    1 will still apply since there is no conflicting declaration in rule 2 */

/* Inheritance */
    /* Inheritance refers to a certain css property that, when applied to an element, is inherited
    by that element's descendents, even if a rule isn't explicitly stated for those.
        Typography based properties such as color, font-size, and font-family are usually inherited
        while most other properties are not.
    The exception to this rule is when directly targeting an element, as this will always beat inheritance. */

/* Rule Order */
    /* The final factor, the end of the line, the tie-breaker. After very other factor has been accounted for,
    there may still be conflicting rules targeting an element. Now what?
        In this case its actually very simple -- the last defined rule will always be the one that takes precedence. */
